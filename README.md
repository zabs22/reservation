# reservation
This repository contains the frontend of a hotel booking application just like booking.com. 

# User Registration and Profile Creation
The first task for any user is to create a profile on the platform. 
This involves registering with the system by providing personal information such as name, email address, and password. 
Additionally, users may need to verify their identity through various methods like phone number verification using Trello or submitting identification documents.

# Accommodation Listings
One of the core tasks of an online reservation system is to allow hosts to list their accommodations. 
Hosts can create detailed listings that include information about the property, such as location, amenities, pricing, availability, and house rules. 
They may also upload high-quality images to showcase their property and attract potential guests.

# Search and Filtering
A crucial feature of any online reservation system is the ability for users to search and filter accommodations based on their preferences. 
Guests can input specific criteria such as location, dates, price range, number of guests, and amenities to narrow down their search results. 
The system then uses these parameters to display a list of relevant accommodations that match the user's requirements.

# Booking and Reservation Management
Once a guest selects an accommodation, they can proceed to book it through the online reservation system. 
The system facilitates secure payment processing, allowing guests to pay for their reservation on the time of approved booking. 
It also handles the reservation management process, ensuring that the accommodation is marked as "booked" for the specified dates and sending confirmation
details to both the guest and the host.

Ratings and Reviews
To build trust and transparency, online reservation systems often incorporate a rating and review system. 
After their stay, guests can leave ratings and reviews for the accommodation and the host. 
These reviews help future guests make informed decisions and provide hosts with feedback to improve their offerings. 
The system may also allow hosts to respond to reviews, resolving any issues or addressing concerns.
